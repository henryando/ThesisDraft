abstract = {Photonic crystal nanocavities that simultaneously possess small modal volumes and high quality (Q) factors have opened up novel research areas in photonics during this decade. Here, we present an important key for the increase of Q factors to ranges beyond ten million. A systematic investigation on photon lifetimes of air-bridge-type heterostructure nanocavities fabricated from silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates indicated the importance of cleaning the bottom side (buried oxide side) of the nanaocavites. Repeated thermal oxidation and an oxide removal process applied after the removal of the buried oxide layer underneath the nanocavities realized an experimental Q factor greater than eleven million, which is the highest experimental Q ever recorded. The results provide important information not only for Si PC nanocavities but also for general Si nanophotonic devices and photonic electronic convergence systems.},

We present a new hybrid platform that integrates amorphous silicon photonic waveguides and microresonators fabricated on top of a yttrium orthosilicate substrate doped with erbium ions. The quality factor of one such resonator was measured to exceed 100,000 and the ensemble cooperativity was measured to be 0.54. The resonator-coupled ions exhibited spontaneous emission rate enhancement and increased coupling to the input field, as required for further development of on-chip quantum light-matter interfaces.},

	abstract = {A successful quantum communication network will rely on the ability to distribute entangled photons over large distances between receiver stations. So far, free-space demonstrations have been limited to line-of-sight links across cities or between mountaintops. Scattering and coherence decay have limited the link separations to around 100 km. Yin et al. used the Micius satellite, which was launched last year and is equipped with a specialized quantum optical payload. They successfully demonstrated the satellite-based entanglement distribution to receiver stations separated by more than 1200 km. The results illustrate the possibility of a future global quantum communication network.Science, this issue p. 1140Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 {\textpm} 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.},
